ðŸ“• First we have to design the Problem Solver Agent and for this we have a to follow the steps that we learn in classes.

  <summary>Formulate the Objective</summary>

  	- The first box must be empty.
        
    - The rest of the boxes must be sorted ascending.

  	- Initial State
		(Messy)
		
	- Objective State
		(Sorted)
		
	- Actions

	- Funcion de Transicion
		TR(Current_State,(

		Move Right to Empty, 
		Move Up to Empty, 
		Move Down to Empty
		)) -> Succesor_State
		
	- Objective Test
		Check thath the current state equals the goal state

	- Cost of the route

## 1. For N = 3
	4! = 24, where 12 states have a solution and 12 haven't solution 

## 2. For N = 8
	9! = 362 880, where 181 440 states have a solution and 181 440 haven't solution
