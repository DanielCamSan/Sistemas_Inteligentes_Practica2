### ðŸ“• First we have to design the Problem Solver Agent and for this we have a to follow the steps that we learn in classes. (Click in the arrow)


<details>
  <summary>Formulate the Objective</summary>

  	- The first box must be empty.
    - The rest of the boxes must be sorted ascending.

  <summary>Formulate the Problem</summary>

  	- Initial State
		(Messy)
		
	- Objective State
		(Sorted)
		
	- Actions
		Move boxes up down, left right it it's possible.
		
	- Funcion de Transicion
		TR(Current_State,(
		Move Left to Empty, 
		Move Up to Empty,
		Move Right to Empty, 
		Move Down to Empty
		)) -> Succesor_State
		
	- Objective Test
		Check thath the current state equals the goal state

	- Cost of the route

## 1. For N = 2

4! = 24, where 12 states have a solution and 12 haven't a solution, eventually we can probe that with the png added in the repository (folder 'Images', name 'N2_Tree_States.png') 

Here we could only have 2 possible states of a node, where one of those possible states from the second state will mostly be a repeated state.

	The code used to get all the states is "n2_3puzzle.py", we used the alghoritms that we saw in classes (BFS)
	The code used to solve the problem is "n2_3puzzle_solver.py", we used BFS
	The code used to generate the csv with all the posible is "display_n_puzzle.py"

## 2. For N = 3

9! = 362 880, where 181 440 states have a solution and 181 440 haven't a solution 

We can probe it with the n=2 puzle code that we made, we did that because building and running all the states in n=3 puzzle takes 6790.9135222435 seconds because the comparisson between all the states with the pointed state takes a lot of time, but it works perfectly. When the program is running we print the number of states.

In both files the code is the same the only variant is the size of the list. Also we made a plus for see all the posible states and exporting them in a csv file:

	The code used to get all the states is "n3_8puzzle.py", we used the alghoritms that we saw in classes (BFS)
	The code used to generate the csv with all the posible is "display_n_puzzle.py"

## 3. For N = 4

15! = 1 307 674 368 000, where only half (653 837 184 000) states have a solution

In this exercise we dont see all the space states in the three, we just focus to identify the difference at using memory and the time used  beetwen the BFS and ID alghoritm, so with that objective we develop 2 files with each alghoritm, we define the initial and goal state in a CSV file that is located in Data_Files=> "Data_15_Puzzle.csv". 

	The code used to get the states used ant the time wasted with BFS is "n4_15puzzle_BFS.py", we used the alghoritms that we saw in classes
	The code used to get the states used ant the time wasted with Iterative Deepening is "n4_15puzzle_ID.py", we used the alghoritms that we saw in classes

Finally with the results we made a table comparing them.

EXPANDED SPACES COMPARISSON

Steps |  BFS  | ID 
:---: | :---: | :---:
6 | 163 States | 1 613 States
7 | 485 States | 9 693 States
8 | 694 States | 15 225 States
9 | 1 897 States | 79 471 States
10 | 5 143 States | 479 109 States
14 | 69 833 States | 33 128 735 States

In conclusion we can see that ID is better than BFS in time comparisson but is worst in Memory Comparisson this is because with DFs we try to expand all the states at the same time  and with ID we look for the state changing the depth if we cant find it, but it uses DFS on the back, also the reason for which the number of states in Id are bigger is because we get the sumatory of all the states in each depth index, and with BFS the use of memory is exponencial.

## Display States

Inside the 'Display_States' folder we can see a .csv file with all possible states (which have a solution and which havn't solution)
in table for N = 2 (3 Puzzle) and N = 3 (8 Puzzle) showing at the End a counter of all states,('All States: 24' and 'All States: 362880').
For N = 4 the csv is too heavy.

## Execution
### N Puzzle
- In the root of project open a terminal.
- Insert the command 'python [file_name].py'.
### Display States
- Inside the 'Display_States' folder open a terminal.
- Insert the command 'python display_n_puzzle.py'.
- Insert the size of the puzzle to graph.
- The file 'N_Puzzle_Output.csv' will be displayed
- All the state tables will be graphed, showing at the end the number of possible states.
