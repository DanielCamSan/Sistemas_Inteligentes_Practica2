ðŸ“• First we have to design the Problem Solver Agent and for this we have a to follow the steps that we learn in classes.

##	1. Formulate the Objective
    
        - The first box must be empty.
        
        - The rest of the boxes must be sorted ascending.

<br />

##	2. Formulate the Problem

		- Initial State

			(Messy)
			
		- Objective State

			(Sorted)
			
		- Actions

			Move boxes up down, left right it it's possible.
			
		- Funcion de Transicion

			TR(Current_State,(
			Move Left to Empty, 
			Move Right to Empty, 
			Move Up to Empty, 
			Move Down to Empty
			)) -> Succesor_State
			
		- Objective Test
        
			Check thath the current state equals the goal state

		- Cost of the route
